"The best classifier was AdaBoost (#5). The p-values of competing classifiers were all statistically significant with P < 0.01 - i.e. there is less than a 1% chance that AdaBoost performs same as the competing classifiers. The lower p-values of the SVCs indicate that the data probably isn't linearly seperable in either the raw basis or radial basis, and the higher p-values of the random forest / neural network imply that the data is probably non-linear, as the non-linear classifiers perform better on it."
