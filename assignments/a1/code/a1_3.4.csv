"The best classifier (#5, AdaBoost, 3.1 accuracy of 0.459) had p-values of ~2E-7, ~2E-6, ~4E-4, and ~8E-3, against the following classifiers: Linear SVC, Radial SVC, Random Forest, Multi-Layer-Perceptron.The relatively small p-values listed are highly statistically significant with all P < 0.001 - there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance that AdaBoost performs same as the competing classifiers."
